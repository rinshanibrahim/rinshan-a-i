    <h3><b>SOP Consulting</b></h3>
    <p>Defining what is also rules out what is not. And based on that premise, anything that is outside the definitions is not required to be practised. In other words, when what is required is established, there is no need to focus anywhere else. The same principle makes SOPs a powerful tool for robust implementation at the operational level. Given below is a Venn representation of this principle.</p>

        <h2><b>How to make a good standard operating procedure</b></h2>
        <p>Among all guidelines for standard operating procedures, if anything should come at first it is drafting. Writing may seem traditional but it has certain inherent benefits to the human perception that even time cannot erode. Writing things down helps in attaining clarity and comprehensiveness of goals and actions. Even if software applications are used to aid the functioning of business processes and operations, documented format is a must.</p>

          <h2><b>Challenges in SOP development and implementation</b></h2>
          <p>While SOPs establish the standards of how things need to be done, there is no universally-recognised standard for writing SOPs. With simpler operations, SOP development may not be a tough task. But when we talk about writing SOPs for complex businesses, processes and operations, a certain degree of expertise and experience becomes essential. For instance, the payroll processes in small enterprises ideally tend to remain simple. </p>

            <h2><b>How we do it: SOP Development Methodology</b></h2>
            <p>With the knowledge of process requirements and the existing ways of working, it becomes feasible to identify any gap or deviation between the two. Finding these deviations to specific details is our objective at this stage. For example, many times, the rulebook says that the HR manager should be approving the salary statements before the documents are sent to the finance department for disbursal following the due process.</p>

        <h2><b>SWOT Analysis</b></h2>
        <p>A good project report development consists of conducting a robust SWOT analysis. What makes SWOT particularly powerful is that, with a little thought, it can help you uncover opportunities that you are well-placed to exploit. And by understanding the weaknesses of your business, we help you manage and eliminate threats that would otherwise catch you unawares. </p>

            <p>The only way to have a strong organization is to delegate responsibility as far down as possible, and then hold people accountable. The interaction amongst the operations needs to be smooth and frequent. We devise SOPs where the entire business communication, reporting & job descriptions are defined & audit parameters are coined to ensure SOPs are being followed.</p>
