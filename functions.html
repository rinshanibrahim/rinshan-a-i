    <h5><b>Purchase Department SOPs</b></h5>
</div>
<div id="func">
   <p>The role of a purchase department is to manage the procurement of the materials required for business operations or production from vendors and suppliers. However, such a narrowed-down description hardly reflects the complexities of managing the purchase function of a company. Behind ensuring a steady flow of materials, a purchase department needs to run several processes flawlessly. If these processes are faulty it could lead to many undesirable circumstances like the selection of ineligible suppliers, misunderstandings about expected results, over-purchase or under purchasing, failing to order on time, etc.<br></p>
   <p>From selecting the right suppliers to managing returns, every key activity of a purchase department can be made process-driven with SOPs.<br></p>

          <h3><b>Vendor Shortlisting and Selection</b></h3>
          <p>‘Who is eligible to supply’ is the question we answer in vendor selection. There should always be a planned and systematic process for shortlisting and selecting vendors and suppliers. For micro and small businesses, even a checklist can fulfil the same purpose. Different businesses will have different strategic requirements in terms of past experiences of the vendors, quality of materials, quantity of supply, transit time, logistical priorities, regulatory factors.</p>

Different companies may have different approaches to how they carry out this onboarding process. Bigger enterprises have lengthy procedures running into days or even weeks.Having SOPs can simplify a complex and lengthy onboarding process. </p>

There are three basic questions which a purchase department needs to answer on a routine basis.The direct impact of prudent reordering per SOPs is on the liquidity and the bottom line (profit)</p>
